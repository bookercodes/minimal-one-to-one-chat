## Running

Clone the repository and, once downloaded, run `npm install` (`yarn` will work too) to install your local dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/bookercodes/react-one-to-one-chat
cd react-one-to-one chat
```

Saucyyy.

Create a new file in the `api` directory called `.env` (the full path would be `/client/.env`) and add your Chatkit **Instance Locator** and **Key**:

```
CHATKIT_INSTANCE_LOCATOR=
KEY=
```

Run the server with `npm start`.

In another terminal window navigate to `client`. In `/src/containers/Chat.js` replace `instanceLocator` with your own.

You should now be able to run the client with `npm start`.

Booyeah!
